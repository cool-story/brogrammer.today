***Disclaimer** if you're actually 12 well, I'm sorry. Go outside and play, you can learn to code when the rockstar/acting/sports career fails. For all other ages, y'all better be easygoing, this blog will end up offending someone at some point because talking code makes everyone butthurt, free code destroys lives, people are cray zay*

*PS no comments or backsies*

The plan
====
</br>

Dissin' code, rewriting code, open sourcing code.

**EZ**

What does this mean? Well, it means this blog is going to be full of heavily opinionated posts, many of which involving reproducing functionality from paid apps for free. But hey! we'll pretend to be learning how2code, win win.

Why go to the trouble?

There's a lot of poor code out there in the wild, is it not the brogrammers duty to educate!?
*Nahhhh* it's because adverts sux, a strong god complex and somebody already put money down on the domain name...

Incase somehow there's someone out there who is looking to learn, to be fair, the hardest part about learning to code is finding practical uses, that and having the time to learn a shit ton of keywords.
