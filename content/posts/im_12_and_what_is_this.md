***Disclaimer** if you're actually 12 well, I'm sorry. Go outside and play, you can learn to code when the rockstar/acting/sports career fails. For all other ages, y'all better be easygoing because this blog will end up offending someone at some point, either because you write crap apps, crap code or just simply aren't down the kids anymore #grampa.*

*PS no comments, deal with it.*

Under the guise of ~~*educating*~~ just kidding, ranting, **brograming.today** is the hero we need to save ourselves from the onslaugh of shit code, some call it **brogramming**. blog is born from opinions, shitty apps and a domain cheap enough to buy.

Your app crashes and takes the android runtime down with it? That's a paddlin'
